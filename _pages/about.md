I received the B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from
Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2019 and 2021. From 2021 to
2022, I was an AI researcher at AIRS Company, Hyundai Motor Group. I am
currently a machine learning engineer at 42dot Inc. My research interests
include deep learning, domain adaptation, and long-tailed recognition.
